            All of us who went through the painful college application process can remember just how hard it was to select the right programs from thousands of choices and making sure each one of the applications was submitted on time. Is it really necessary to go through so much anxiety and effort? At Uniq, we are creating the next generation mobile college application guide specifically made for high school students. The app can save an enormous amount of time by delivering the exact information that students are looking for with just a few taps.
